This means there is no server associated with this domain.\n\nHere's what happened:\n\n1. **URL Failure**: The URL provided is invalid or non-existent, meaning we couldn't find a server to handle requests for this domain.\n2. **Error Message**: When attempting to fetch the content, the tool encountered an error (`URLError` with `gaierror(8)`), indicating that neither a name nor a service was provided, or they are not known.\n\nTo resolve this issue:\n- Please ensure the URL is correct and accessible.\n- Check your internet connection and try again later.\n- If you intended to use a different domain, please provide the correct URL.\n\nFor reference, here's an example of what we can fetch from a valid URL:\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head><title>Example Domain</title>\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n<style>body{background:#eee;width:60vw;margin:15vh auto;font-family:system-ui,sans-serif}h1{font-size:1.5em}div{opacity:0.8}a:link,a:visited{color:#348}</style>\n<body><div><h1>Example Domain</h1>\n<p>This domain is for use in documentation examples without needing permission. Avoid using it in operations.<p><a href=\"https://iana.org/domains/example\">Learn more</a></div></body></html>\n```\n\n---\n\nRegarding the code snippet you provided:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n```\n\nThis line of code imports the `List` type from the `typing` module. The `List` type is commonly used for specifying that a variable should be a list (or array) in type hints, which can help with static type checking and documentation.\n\nIf you have any specific tasks or questions related to this import statement, feel free to ask! For instance, if you need examples on how to use `List`, I'd be happy to provide them.\n\nThank you for your understanding!\n\n---\n\nAdditionally, here are the stubbed weather data points you mentioned:\n\n- **Weather in City A**: 18C, clear\n- **Weather in City B**: 18C, clear\n\nIf you need further assistance with any of these topics or have other questions, please let me know!"}
